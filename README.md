# tombala-draweR
This is Shiny app for drawing random numbers to play "Tombala" game!

We are all prisoned at home during the Xmas period of 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic. 
If you are one of those who used to play [Tombala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombola_(raffle)) on new year's eve, but you need to do it over Skype this year, this app is for you. 
I am ordered to draw the numbers this Xmas eve and I am lazy to do it with pen & paper. This app is supposed to serve me tonight. 
Perhaps, you are also as lazy as I am, so please be my guest to use the app. 

**Disclaimer**: This app is written in a very short time for a specific purpose. If you happen to find bugs or you have ideas for improvement, you know what to do ;)

Merry Xmas & happy new year!
